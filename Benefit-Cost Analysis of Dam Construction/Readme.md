# Benefit-Cost Analysis of Dam Construction

To determine which building plan is more advantageous for us, run a benefit to cost analysis using Excel for two distinct dams with their relative advantages and costs. For each, a simulation of 10,000 was run using a triangular distribution. To draw a conclusion, the findings were then evaluated for chi square goodness of fit. Finally, the two dam building models were compared, and the superior model was chosen.

## Skill used â€“ 

Excel, Hypothesis Testing, Random Sampling, Triangular Probability Distribution, Simulation.

## Output-

A report on the Benefit-Cost Analysis of Dam Construction that is well-structured and unbiased. With the use of this, we were able to create a simulation that, whenever it is performed, will compare the results from the two dam building models. a situation where it is obvious which dam building model is superior.
