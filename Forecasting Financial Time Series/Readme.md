# Forecasting Financial Time Series

Estimating both the long-term and short-term forecasting values for the stocks of APPL (Apple Inc.) and HON (Honeywell Inc.) using forecasting time series analysis in Excel. Additionally, evaluating various predicting alpha and beta values and choosing the best one. To determine if our long-term forecasting or short-term forecasting is more accurate, we tested using their MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error). Regression analysis on both stocks will be performed at the conclusion, along with checks for homoscedasticity, independence, and normal distribution, and a chi-square goodness of fit test.

## Output-

An objective report on forecasting financial time series that is well-organized. We were able to predict the stock prices of APPL and HON using this. Additionally, by doing regression analysis, we were able to use the Q-Q Plot to confirm their normality.
