# Binary and Non Linear Programming Model

Implementing binary and nonlinear programming models in Excel to solve real-world challenges. In order to find the optimal route and reduce overall costs, transport and transshipment problems can be solved using binary programming. The best stock is then created utilizing non-linear programming for investment allocation in order to maximize return with the least amount of risk.
